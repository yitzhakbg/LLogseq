	- Estimate that around 10k new Ankimobile customers who pay $25 per shot are joining every month and that Ankidroid and Anki Desktop downloads are somewhat compatible, then ball park +/- 360,000 new users per year. Even on the assumption that not everyone who downloads actually practices, still we have an estimated picture.
