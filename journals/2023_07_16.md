	- The third reason, *3. REVIEWING OLD CARDS CAN BECOME A CHORE* is inaccurate since previously learned cards fade into the background and presented less frequently as they are rated as learned-better.
	- The fourth reason, _4. FLASHCARDS TAKE LANGUAGE OUT OF CONTEXT_ is true but not inclusive in that when the word is then taught in context, it is already familiar and sticks.
	- The fifth reason _5. BRAIN-FRIENDLY LEARNING STRATEGIES MAKE SRS APPS IRRELEVANT_ wrongly assumes that one method is exclusively pitched against another but there is no reason not to use Anki complementary together with other learning strategies.
