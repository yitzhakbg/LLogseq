- ## [[No need for teachers]] #Anki #Anki_Presentation
	- That's exactly how Anki and other SRS systems are used by individual students. Their teachers/professors couldn't care less how their students review the material.
	- While Anki and other spaced repetition systems (SRS) can be used by individual students to practice and review material on their own, there are several reasons why teachers can still play a valuable role in the use of these tools:
	- Setting up the decks: Teachers can create Anki decks with appropriate content and difficulty level for their students, or provide guidance on how to create a deck that aligns with the curriculum.
	- Providing context and understanding: While Anki can help students commit information to memory, it is still important for students to understand the material they are studying. Teachers can provide context, explanations, and real-world examples to help students understand the material and make connections to what they already know.
	- Assessing progress: Teachers can use Anki to track student progress and identify areas where students may need additional support. They can also provide feedback and support to help students overcome any challenges they may be facing with the material.
	- Encouraging consistent use: It can be easy for students to fall behind or lose motivation when using Anki or other SRS tools. Teachers can help motivate and encourage students to consistently use the tool to review material and stay on track with their studies.
	  
	  Overall, while Anki and other SRS tools can be used effectively by individual students, teachers can play a valuable role in supporting and guiding students in their use of these tools to help them achieve their learning goals.
